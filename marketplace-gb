ScyllaDB is written in C++, rather than Cassandra's Java, for better resource usage that can result in ten times better performance in benchmarks. Whilst retaining compatibility with Cassandra tool and data files, ScyllaDB adds self tuning capabilities. IBM Compose for ScyllaDB makes ScyllaDB even better by managing it for you.
